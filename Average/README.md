# Average Algorithm of an Array of values

The following algorithm computes the average of the values stored in <em>Array</em>[ ] of <em>n</em> values. 
That is, for example in the data of Cities and their Population, then calling the function Average in the form "Average(<em>Population</em>, 100)", enables us to compute the average
of one hundred values of population, of one hundred Cities, where <em>Population</em>[ <em>i</em> ] already records the values of the population of the <em>i</em>th City.
